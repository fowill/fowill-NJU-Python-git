# captcha_torch
A PyTorch script for identifying the number captchas

This is a simple PyTorch script to identify captchas using CNN, which is a part of my homework for **'Big Data Analytic'** lesson in Shanghai University.

Here's a simple guide about the scripts:</br>
1. Run create captchas.ipynb for randomly creating captchas</br>
2. Upload the captchas in *step1* to **Google Colab**</br>
3. Run captcha.ipynb in **Colab Environment** to train and test a CNN</br>
